# Best Of CH - Twitter Bot

> **_NOTE:_**  Because of changes to the Twitter API on February 9th the Bot will be inactive.

Retweets the most liked tweets from the week from the people the bot follows.

The Twitter Bot goes through all the users that it currently follows and excludes every protected (privacy locked). While going through the tweets from the last seven days it checks the likes and places it in the dictionary ranked first, second or third place according to likes amount.
While ranking the tweets the bot also collects some statistics to display them after the third most liked tweet.
After everything is done the bot quote-retweets the three most liked tweets in order and the statistics at the end.
